### GeoJSON

In this workshop we are going to use the `us-states.json` by Mike Bostock. We assume that you have knowledge (or are willing learn!) about shapefiles. 

Useful tools to get data fit the formats:
- geojson.io
- THIS: http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/

### Source of our json file

http://leafletjs.com/examples/us-states.js

We are not using it as a js variable. We are using it as `us-states.json` in the folder. You can read more about loading external json in leaflet in this [post](http://lyzidiamond.com/posts/external-geojson-and-leaflet-the-other-way/)
